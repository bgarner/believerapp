            <strong><em>Last modified: 11/06/2019</em></strong>
                <p>
                Culturebrand, Inc. and its affiliates or subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our”, and similar expressions) value your privacy and we want you to understand how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and disclose your personal information when you visit www.believer.io (our “Website”), use our applications (“Apps”), sign up for an account with us (an “Account”) (the foregoing collectively, the “Services”) and otherwise interact with us. By using our Website or any of our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, our Website Terms of Use and other policies applicable to our relationship with you.
                </p>

                <h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy.</h3>
                <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this Website or the Services after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
                </p>

                <h3>What is “Personal Information”?</h3>
                <p>“Personal information” is generally any information about an identifiable individual, which includes information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a natural person.</p>

                <h3>What personal information do we collect and use about you?</h3>
                <p>There are several types of information we collect about you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Personal Information you give us directly, such as information you give when you: contact us through email, SMS (text)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        messages, form submissions on the Website, and other electronic messages between you and us (collectively, “Electronic Messages”) or by phone or mail; post on or through the public areas or features on our Website or in the Services; sign up for an Account; use our Apps; usage data you may provide to us through the communication and help and support systems in our Services.
                    </li>                    

                    <li>
                        Like most websites, we collect information about you when you come to our Website, like your Internet protocol (IP) address, the website you visited before coming to our Website, your browser type and settings, log data, your device information (for example, if you’re using a tablet, mobile phone, or desktop computer and the operating system), the date and time when you visited the Website, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, your language preferences, and other unique identifiers.
                    </li>                    

                    <li>
                        How you navigate and use our Website and Services, like the pages you viewed and other interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and time spent on a particular interaction).
                    </li>                    

                    <li>
                        When you come to our Website or use our Services, we may collect information about your geographic location.
                    </li>                    

                    <li>
                        Information we collect, through cookies and similar technologies or otherwise, to provide and support our Website and the Services.
                    </li>                    

                    <li>
                        Information you provide to create and manage your Account, such as a username, email address, and a password. You may also provide us with other optional information as part of your Account profile, such as avatars, other contact information, and links to social network profiles you have (including when used for authentication purposes).
                    </li>                                                                                                                        
                </ul>

                <h3>What non-personal information do we collect and use?</h3>
                <p>
                Personal information does not include information that has been anonymized or aggregated in such a way that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether on its own or in combination with other information. We may use your personal information to create this kind of anonymized or aggregated data.
                </p>

                <h3>Information from cookies and similar tracking technologies.</h3>
                
                <p>What is a cookie? An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on a person’s computer by their web browser.</p>
                <p>Cookies are a mechanism for websites to remember information about a person (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the person's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember what the person previously entered into form fields such as names and addresses.</p>
                <p>Cookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether a person is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in.</p>
                <p>Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies, are commonly used as ways to create long-term records of a person's browsing histories, show targeted advertisements to them across the Internet, and track behaviour, such as whether an email has been received and opened.</p>
                <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and other automated tracking methods on our Website, in connection with the Services and in communications with you. In addition to these general uses of cookies we went over above, here are some examples of how we use cookies:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To identify you electronically and store your preferences for viewing our Website and its pages.</li>
                    <li>To track your prior visits to our Website and elsewhere on the Internet in order to serve you targeted ads, including through our third-party advertising service providers.</li>
                    <li>To recognize your device and provide you with a personalized experience on our Website and in connection with the Services, including to remember your Account settings and enable your Account features and functions.</li>
                    <li>To measure performance and engagement.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you have questions about how we use cookies, please contact our Privacy Officer.</p>

                <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
                <p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information for several purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To make our Website and Services available to you.</li>
                    <li>To improve our Website, Services, and customer experience.</li>
                    <li>To give you with notices about your relationship with us.</li>
                    <li>To market our business to you.</li>
                    <li>To measure or understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you.</li>
                    <li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights under contracts, including for billing or to comply with legal requirements.</li>
                    <li>To fulfill the purposes that you provided the information to us for or that were described when it was collected, or any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
                    <li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.</li>
                    <li>For other purposes with your consent.</li>
                    <li>For any of the other reasons we describe in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When we might disclose your information to others?</h3>
                <p>We might disclose your personal information to others for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We may share it with our subsidiaries and affiliates in connection with our business.</li>
                    <li>To advertisers so they can select and serve relevant advertisements to you and others.</li>
                    <li>To a company that acquires our business, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding. If this happens, we will post a notice.</li>
                    <li>To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business. For example, to shipping services, analytics and search engine providers that help us improve our Website, contractors that service our business and have agreed to keep the information we share confidential or, in our judgment, have privacy policies and practices consistent with our own Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.</li>
                    <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information or as outlined elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li>Disclosure we make with your consent.</li>
                    <li>As required by law or a court order or other legal, governmental, or regulatory process.</li>
                    <li>To enforce or apply our other terms of use, terms of service, policies, and other conditions you agree to from time to time.</li>
                    <li>If we believe disclosing personal information is important to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or others and is otherwise allowed by law (for example, to help reduce the risk of credit card fraud).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>European Economic Area and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</h3>
                <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under European law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, or object to certain uses of your personal data.</p>
                <p>If you wish to exercise these rights, please reach contact us. If you are unhappy with the response that you receive from us we hope that you would contact us to resolve the issue, but you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority in your jurisdiction at any time.</p>
                <p>If you are in the EEA, please note that we are generally processing your information to fulfill contracts we might have with you or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed in this Privacy Policy. In particular, we process your personal data to pursue the following legitimate interests, either for ourselves or third parties connected to our business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide our Website and Services.</li>
                    <li>To prevent risk and fraud in connection with our Website and Services.</li>
                    <li>To provide communications, marketing, and advertising.</li>
                    <li>To provide reporting and analytics.</li>
                    <li>To provide troubleshooting, support services, or to answer questions.</li>
                    <li>To test out features or additional services.</li>
                    <li>To improve our Website and Services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                When we process personal information to pursue these legitimate interests, we do so where we believe the nature of the processing, the information being processed, and the technical and organisational measures employed to protect that information can help mitigate the risks to the data subject.
                </p>

                <h3>Where we may store and process your information.</h3>
                <p>We are based out of Canada, but we may process, store, and transfer personal information in Canada or elsewhere, such as the United States. For example, we could use third-party service providers, such as managed hosting providers, and technology partners to provide the necessary software, networking, infrastructure and other services that we use to operate the Website and Services. These third-party providers may process, or store, personal information on servers outside of Canada.</p>
                <p>Locations other than Canada may have different privacy laws, which may be more or less protective. If we move personal information to a location other than Canada, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country may have access to your personal information through their laws.</p>
                <p>Your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, or stored for any purpose stated in this Privacy Policy in the United States.</p>

                <h3>Controlling and accessing your personal information.</h3>
                <p>Like many Websites and other companies, we may ask you to sign up to receive emails and other Electronic Messages from us. If you no longer wish to receive those messages, you can opt-out by following the unsubscribe link in the messages or by contacting us.</p>
                <p>You may also adjust your browser settings to block cookies and other tracking technologies. Please note though, we do not provide your browser to you so we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of those settings. If you have questions about your browser settings and how they impact the effectiveness of cookies and other similar tracking technologies, please contact the browser provider for help and support. Unfortunately, we cannot help with those kinds of technical questions.</p>
                <p>You can also make many changes to your personal information directly through your Account. If you are unable to change your personal information within your Account settings, or if you are concerned about data collected about you, please contact us.</p>

                <h3>How do we keep your personal information secure?</h3>
                <p>We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial information, intellectual property, and any other personal information entrusted to us. Our information security systems apply to people, processes, and information technology systems on a risk management basis.</p>
                <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.</p>

                <h3>How long do we keep your personal information?</h3>
                <p>In general, we keep your personal information throughout your relationship with us. Once you terminate your relationship with us, we will continue to store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business purposes, like defending a contractual claim or for audit purposes and to comply with the law. We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our Services.</p>

                <h3>Automated decision-making and your personal information.</h3>
                <p>We use several machine learning algorithms and forms of automated decision-making. For example, we use automated decision-making to prevent risk and fraud, to personalize your experience and make it more efficient, and to determine eligibility for certain services or features we offer on our Website and Services.</p>

                <h3>Children and privacy.</h3>
                <p>Our Website and its features and Services are not meant for children under 13 years of age. See our Website Terms of Use for more details. If you are under 13 years old, please do not give us your personal information. If you are the parent or guardian of someone under 13 years of age, please do not give us personal information of that person.</p>

                <h3>How to contact us about privacy questions.</h3>
                <p>If you have a question or a concern about our Privacy Policy or your personal information, please get in touch with us. Our Privacy Officer can be reached at <a href="mailto:privacy@believerapp.com">privacy@believerapp.com</a>.</p>
