                <p><strong>4. Arbitration</strong></p>
                <p>Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
                <p>Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Site and your relationship with us or any of our subsidiary, parent, or affiliate companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration.</p>
                <p>For all disputes, you must first send a written description of your claim to us to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Each of us agrees to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days.</p>
                <p>The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted and finally resolved in accordance with the rules of the Canadian Arbitration Association ("CAA"), including the CAA's Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by these Terms. Any arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in Alberta or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language unless otherwise mutually agreed by us in writing or otherwise required by law. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief, to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. There will be no appeal from the decision of the arbitrator on questions of fact, law, or mixed fact and law. </p>
                <p>Each party will bear the fees and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
